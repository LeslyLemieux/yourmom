<h1>Introduction</h1>
<p>
    Hello, we are group 1 Pepeng and in this website we will be talking about what typhoons are,<br>
    how they form, what their impacts are and how we can mitigate it. So now let’s start by trying<br>
    to figure out what typhoons are.<br>
</p>
<br>
<h1>What are typhoons?</h1>
<p>
    Based on our research A typhoon is a mature tropical cyclone that develops between 180° and<br>
    100°E in the Northern Hemisphere.<br>
</p>

<br>
<h1>How do they form?</h1>
<p>
    A typhoon forms when winds blow into areas of the ocean where the water is warm. These winds<br>
    collect moisture and rise, while colder air moves in below. This creates pressure, which causes<br>
    the winds to move very quickly. The winds rotate, or spin, around a center called an eye.<br>
</p>
<br>
<h1>What are the impacts of a typhoon?</h1>
<p>
    Typhoons are often accompanied by secondary disasters, such as floods and landslides, that can<br>
    cause severe damage to or even the destruction of houses and infrastructure and pose a great<br>
    threat to human life, especially in coastal areas.<br>

<br>
<h1>Our proposed solution:</h1>
<p>
    Now that we know a lot about typhoons we will now show you our proposed/planned solution<br>
    which is a poster. You might think this is too common and simple, and yes you’re right it is<br>
    very simple which means that we can easily make one but the difference would be that Our posters<br>
    would contain new terms or words that our generation uses so it can be more relatable and easier<br>
    to understand for the people of our generation.<br>
</p>
<br>
<h1>Our goal and target audience:</h1>
<p>
    Our Goal is to mitigate the impacts of typhoons and help people be more aware about typhoons,<br>
    our target audience would be teenagers since they are the people who use social media a lot.<br>
</p>
<br>
<h1>How is this effective?</h1>
<p>
    This is very effective because first of all, It is an online poster and almost everyone uses<br>
    the internet according to google there are 4b+ people who uses the internet every single day,<br>
    and a poster is very easy to understand and read it is also very cheap and not time consuming<br>
    to make so we think that our solution can be very effective.
</p>
<br>
<h1>How can we achieve this?</h1>
<p>
    We can achieve this by spreading our posters to popular social media apps like Facebook,<br>
    Instagram, twitter, etc.<br>
</p>
<br>
<h1>Conclusion</h1>
<p>
    In conclusion, typhoons are very dangerous. That is why we should handle it seriously and<br>
    prepare ahead of time to avoid damages and deaths. We should also do our part into taking<br>
    care of our environment because if we take care of it more we can avoid further damages of<br>
    a typhoon that is all and I hope you learned something from our website.<br>
